description: Use when setting this agent up in a folder for the first time — creates the instance (instance.yaml, host files, your context) and runs the interview, if the agent has one.
---

Creates an instance: the folder that holds your data for this agent.
The agent's logic stays in its package. In plugin mode nothing is
written into the package. Read this agent's name, version, and
optional `catalog` / `catalog_repo` from `agent.yaml` in the package
folder.

1. **Existing instance.** First, before anything else: if this folder
   or any folder above it holds an `instance.yaml` for this agent,
   stop — offer to re-run only the interview there. (This covers
   source mode too.)
2. **Mode.** Use source mode when the user or the new-agent wizard
   asks for it, or when the current folder holds this agent's
   `AGENT.md` and `agent.yaml` (you are inside the package itself).
   Otherwise use plugin mode, the default. In plugin mode never write
   inside the package folder (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` on Claude Code);
   if the chosen folder is inside it, ask for another location.

**Source mode** (the agent's own folder holds its logic — a personal
agent or a "Use this template" copy): use the package folder itself
(no subfolder proposal); write `instance.yaml` with `mode: source`;
skip step 5's host files if `CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md`/`AGENTS.md`
already point at `AGENT.md` (they do after `install.sh`), otherwise
write "Read `AGENT.md` in this folder."; skip step 7 (settings) and
step 8's copy — `context/` is already here; still create
`context/samples/` and run the `interview-business` skill, if this
agent has one.

3. **Folder.** If the current folder is empty (dot files aside), use it.
   Otherwise propose `./<agent name>/` and confirm. If an
   `instance.yaml` for this agent already exists there, stop and offer
   to re-run only the interview. If an `instance.yaml` for a
   different agent exists there, stop and ask — never overwrite it.
   Every later step writes into this folder (the instance folder),
   not the current folder.
4. **Marker.** Write `instance.yaml`:
   `agent: <name>`, `agent_version: <version>`, `standard: "1.1"`,
   `mode: plugin`.
5. **Host files.** Write `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `AGENTS.md`, each:
   "This folder is an instance of <name>. Its instructions load from the
   <name> plugin; if they didn't, run the `start` skill." Do not
   overwrite an existing file — append the line instead, only if the
   file doesn't already contain it.
6. **.gitignore.** Create or extend it with: `.env`, `.env.*`,
   `**/credentials.json`, `**/*.key`, `.DS_Store`.
7. **Host settings.** If `catalog` and `catalog_repo` are set, create or
   merge `.claude/settings.json` so it contains
   `extraKnownMarketplaces.<catalog>` = `{"source": {"source": "github",
   "repo": "<catalog_repo>"}}` and `enabledPlugins."<name>@<catalog>"` =
   `true`. Keep every existing key; never replace the file.
8. **Context.** In the instance folder (the subfolder, if step 3
   created one), copy only the context files the interview fills from
   the package's `context/` into the instance's `context/`, skipping
   any that already exist: `context/business-profile.md`, `context/icp.md`, `context/operating-config.md`. Other files in the
   package's `context/` stay in the package and are read from there.
   Create `context/samples/` in the instance: the user's own examples
   go there (the package's `samples/` holds only the examples the
   agent ships with). Then run the `interview-business` skill, if this
   agent has one, to fill the copied files with the user.
9. **Version control.** Offer `git init` and a first commit, in a
   private repository. Remind the user that credentials belong in the
   host (connectors, MCP settings, environment variables), never in
   these files.
10. **Open.** If step 3 created a subfolder, tell the user: "Open your
    host in <folder> — the agent loads there."

Never invent the user's facts; what they don't supply stays as the
package's bracketed prompt.
